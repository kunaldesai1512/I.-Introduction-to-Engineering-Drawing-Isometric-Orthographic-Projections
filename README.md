# I.-Introduction-to-Engineering-Drawing-Isometric-Orthographic-Projections


Isometric and orthographic projections are two different methods used in technical drawing and engineering to represent three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface like paper or a computer screen. 

# Orthographic Projection:

Definition: Orthographic projection is a technique used to represent a 3D object in two dimensions by projecting its views onto three mutually perpendicular planes: front, top, and side (usually left or right).

# Isometric Projection:

Definition: Isometric projection is a method of representing a 3D object on a 2D surface where all three principal axes (x, y, z) are equally foreshortened, resulting in a non-distorted and uniform scale along each axis.
